# Contributing to WildCore

We are excited about your interest in contributing! Here are some guidelines to help you get started.

## Reporting Bugs

* Use the GitHub **Issues** section to report bugs.
* Be as detailed as possible. Include your Python version, dependencies, and the steps to reproduce the bug.

## Suggesting Enhancements

* Use the **Issues** section to suggest new features. Explain the use case and why the enhancement would be useful.

## Pull Request Process

1. **Fork** the repository and create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/my-feature`).
2. Run `make bootstrap` once to set up the development toolchain and git hooks.
3. Implement your changes with accompanying tests, documentation, and changelog updates.
4. Verify locally with `make check` (or the individual Make targets if you need to iterate).
5. Commit using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) and push your branch.
6. Open a **Pull Request** with a clear summary of the change.

### Licensing of Contributions

## Code Style & Quality

* Follow PEP 8 and the automated tooling enforced by `make lint` and `make fmt`.
* Include docstrings for public functions, classes, and modules.
* Write deterministic unit tests under `tests/unit/` and mirror source structure.
